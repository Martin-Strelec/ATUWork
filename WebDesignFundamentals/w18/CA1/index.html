            <p>Chocolate or cocoa is a food made from roasted and ground cacao seed kernels that is available as a liquid,
                solid, or paste, either on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods. Cacao has been consumed in some form 
                for at least 5,300 years starting with the Mayo-Chinchipe culture in what is present-day Ecuador 
                and later Mesoamerican civilizations also consumed chocolate beverages before being introduced to Europe in the 16th century.
