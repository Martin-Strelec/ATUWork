            <p id="mainText">Coccinellidae is a widespread family of small beetles. 
                They are commonly known as ladybugs in North America and ladybirds in the United Kingdom; 
                "lady" refers to mother Mary. Entomologists use the names ladybird beetles or lady beetles to avoid confusion with true bugs. 
                The more than 6,000 described species have a global distribution and are found in a variety of habitats. 
                They are oval beetles with a domed back and flat underside. 
                Many of the species have conspicuous aposematic (warning) colours and patterns, such as red with black spots, 
                that warn potential predators that they taste bad.
