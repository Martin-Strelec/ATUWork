            <p id="mainText">Bees are winged insects closely related to wasps and ants, known for their roles in pollination and, 
                in the case of the best-known bee species, the western honey bee, for producing honey. 
                Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea. 
                They are currently considered a clade, called Anthophila. 
                There are over 20,000 known species of bees in seven recognized biological families. 
                Some species including honey bees, bumblebees, 
                and stingless bees live socially in colonies while most species (>90%) including mason bees, carpenter bees, 
                leafcutter bees, and sweat bees are solitary.
